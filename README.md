# SimpleTemplate

If you're like me and not happy with current ang2 templates, you're in luck because there is an abundance of sexy looking templates. I've used a free sexy bootstrap template from Creative Tim http://www.creative-tim.com please do check them out.

# About the dashboard

Thought it would be a good exercise to utilise an existing template and plug it onto an angular 2 app. This example makes usage of angular 2 quick start examples and retro fitted to work within the template. 
You'll notice some basic animation and the usage of observables between the side bar and the top nav bar. 

# Reference

http://akveo.com/ng2-admin/ this guys have created a fancy dashboard theme showing some great ng2 capabilities (thank you). I've used some of their approaches as guidance to creating my simple dashboard example.
